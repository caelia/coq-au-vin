* Teaser formatting: teasers seem to be only partially Markdown-
  formatted. Is this due to linebreaks being removed in pre-
  processing?

* Missing tags: sometimes I enter multiple tags in the form,
  but only one shows up.

* Some form fields display default text, others don't. E.g.
  on the current form has "Enter Series Title" in the Series
  input field, but the Subtitle input is blank.
